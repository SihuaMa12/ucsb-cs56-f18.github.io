bio: >
  I’m Mahnaz Koupaee a second-year Masters student working in NLP lab with professor William Wang. 
  I’ve been a TA since I joined UCSB for multiple courses such as CS4, CS8, CS48, CS64 and CS138. 
  Programming courses gives us the opportunity to create cool things step-by-step and make us feel good about ourselves and our abilities!
  What I like about the lab sections is the interaction we have with students individually answering their questions by explaining things as clearly as possible, helping them accomplish what they desire. 
  Feel free to contact me to talk about CS56 or anything I might help you with.
