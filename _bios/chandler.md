bio: >
    My name is Chandler and I’m a fifth year Computer Science major. I came to UCSB with the intention of majoring in Chemsitry but I was lucky enough to switch into CS during the end of my second year and have loved it ever since! I did an internship last summer at a remote company in downtown Santa Barbara slinging Java code and this summer I’m doing programming language research under Ben Hardekopf in the PLλab. I’m also one of the head coordinators for SB Hacks, UCSB’s yearly hackathon, and a product manager for GoGaucho. In my free time I like to (very slowly) learn new programming languages, visit National Parks, and collect video games. I have taken every single required upper division course so if you have any questions about CS or UCSB undergrad, I’m your guy. Cheers!
