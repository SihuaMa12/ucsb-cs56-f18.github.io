bio: >
   My name is Fuheng Zhao. I am going to be a junior at UCSB, double major in mathematical science and computer science. In this summer, I am working with Professor Atzberger in diffusion maps, a technique to perform dimension reduction.    I have taken CS 56 before with Professor Conrad and my legacy code project was the checkers game. Last summer, I interned at a local company in Beijing. During the internship, I learned about HTML and JavaScript and helped senior web programmer to create website pages.
