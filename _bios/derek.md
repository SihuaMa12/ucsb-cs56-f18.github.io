bio: >
   My name is Derek (Guancheng Ren). Currently a fourth year CS major student. My field of study is machine learning (mainly image processing and natural language processing). I took the CS56 with Prof. Conrad last winter quarter, when I worked on the TODO-List legacy code project. For the project I wrote the unit and integration tests using Junit. Designed the UI using Java Swing and HTML. And implemented a Saving/Loading mechanism with Java Serialization. Aside from Java, I am also familiar with HTML/JavaScript and socket programming, which I believe will be very useful for developing web apps. Ask me questions if you have any.
