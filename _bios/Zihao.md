bio: >
    Junior student major in Computer science. Fresh man project Sensor / Remote controlled ORV. Sophomore project supper-fun       version zombie vs. plants. Like building things that are fun.
    For this course, I am planning on creating and working on a project called shift coverer that is made for student workers     in campus to find shift cover when they are unavailable to work. ( If you ever worked as a part-time worker in campus, you     would know that find a a cover for your shift when you do not or can not work is a huge trouble, but with this app,           student workers may better coordinate their hours and got each otherâ€™s back. )
    If you feel interested, please feel free to contact me. ( If this app turns out to be good I would strongly recommend it       to my supervisor in UCEN who might be happy to adopt and promote it lol. )
